Maybe rearranging the moves in twiststore would speed up the search.
Use a hash map for getting moves/moveFuncs.
When checking if a corner is solved, it's probably only necessary to check two sides.
Consider using bitboards for the cube storage.  If each layer is stored in a long then shifting sould move the layer.
I commented out one of the prunes in CubeSearcher.cpp.  This can't be used currently because G1 moves exclude primes and doubles.
There's some repeated code in the model twist stores.  Doesn't bug me that bad.
Clean up all commented code in GoalG2_G3_*
Try to solve the cube outright, then bail at depth 10.
Reduce resulting move set (e.g. L L L is L').
