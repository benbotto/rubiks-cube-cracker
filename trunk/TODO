Maybe rearranging the moves in twiststore would speed up the search.
Use a hash map for getting moves/moveFuncs.
In RubiksCubeModel do all moves statically rather than creating a copy and looping.
When checking if a corner is solved, it's probably only necessary to check two sides.
Consider using bitboards for the cube storage.  If each layer is stored in a long then shifting sould move the layer.
